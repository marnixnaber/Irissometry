# Irissometry

Thank you for downloading the irissometry toolbox!

The irissometry implementation does the following:
- Detects the eye's pupil in close-up videos using a starburst-like algorithm (see function detectPupil)
- Tracks points and calculate distances within the iris
- Spits out a matrix containing data about the pupil center coordinates, pupil size, iris feature distances, etc.
- Saves output matrix in .mat file and .csv file
- Plots some graphs with pupil radius and position data over time

For more info about input and output (io), enter "help irissometry" in the command.

See "example.m" for an example code. Just run it, select one or more videos, and observe the magic.

## Info for videos:
Make sure that the videos do not display black borders at the edge of the frame 
because this causes the pupil border detection to fail. This is how a video frame should look like:

## Required software:
The code has been tested in MATLAB 2019b on a windows 10 machine. 
No guarantees can be provided for other MATLAB versions and operating platforms.

Please note that you need the computer vision toolbox and image processing toolbox to get the code to work.

Please contact Marnix Naber in case you cannot get the code to work.
