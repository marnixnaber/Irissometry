Thank you for downloading the irissometry toolbox!

The irissometry implementation does the following:
- Detects the eye's pupil in close-up videos using a starburst-like algorithm (see function detectPupil)
- Tracks points and calculate distances within the iris
- Spits out a matrix containing data about the pupil center coordinates, pupil size, iris feature distances, etc.

For more info about input and output (io), enter "help irissometry" in the command.
# Irissometry

See "example.m" for an example code. Just run it, select one or more videos, and observe the magic

Please cite our work in case you use our implementation!

Info for videos:
Make sure that the videos do not display black borders at the edge of the frame 
because this negatively affects the pupil border script


Required software:
MATLAB. Software has been tested with MATLAB 2019b on a windows machine. 
No guarantees can be provided for other MATLAB versions and operating platforms.
Please note that you need the computer vision toolbox and image processing toolbox to get the code to work.
Please contact Marnix Naber in case you cannot get the code to work.
